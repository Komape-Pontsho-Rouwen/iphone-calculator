About Me / This Project

I built this project to practice front end development and recreate a complex interface from scratch. It’s a mix of attention to UI/UX detail, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling.
It’s also my first step toward more interactive web projects, so if you spot improvements or want to give feedback, feel free to reach out!
